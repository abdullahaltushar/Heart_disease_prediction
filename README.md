# Heart Disease Prediction![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/53476981/182079370-f481b21b-ec96-41b0-b983-8a995adb7fe9.png weight=50px)


Thus preventing Heart diseases has become more than necessary. Good data-driven systems for predicting heart diseases can improve the entire research and prevention process, making sure that more people can live healthy lives. This is where Machine Learning comes into play. Machine Learning helps in predicting the Heart diseases, and the predictions made are quite accurate.
 Machine Learning algorithms used:

    Logistic Regression (Scikit-learn)
    Decision Tree (Scikit-learn)
    Random Forest (Scikit-learn)
    Artificial Neural Network with 2 Hidden layer (Keras)
